User stories

```
As an employee,
So that my manager can see what I've done
I want to be able to write up an achievement

As a manager,
So that I can assess my team's progress
I would like to see their achievements

As an employee,
So that I don't make silly typos,
I want the option to confirm my achievement before I submit it - or alternatively to change it

As a manager,
So that the information in the app is consistent and transparent,
I don't want my employees to be able to edit or delete an achievement after a certain amount of time
```
